Welcome to Haskell!
-------------------

This material is available in two formats: both
[online](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis5520/current/stub/01-basics/Basics.html),
and embedded in the comments of a Haskell module in the repository
[01-basics](https://github.com/upenn-cis5520/01-basics) on github. We have prepared
instructions on using
[github with CIS 5520](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis5520/current/version.html)
and with installing
[GHC and VSCode](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis5520/current/haskell-vscode.html).
We strongly encourage you to read this module using the VSCode editor so that you
can experiment with it.

This module is an introduction to the basics of the Haskell language. It explains
the components of the language through examples and provides exercises
to test your understanding.

First, every Haskell file begins with the name of the module (this name must
start with a capital letter and be the same as the name of the file, without the `.hs`).
After that, the next lines specify definitions that are imported from other modules.
These import lines must be at the beginning of the file, before any other definitions.

-- library imports must come at the beginning of the module
-- these come from the HUnit library for unit testing
import Test.HUnit
  ( Counts,
    Test (TestList),
    runTestTT,
    (~?),
    (~?=),
  )
import Prelude hiding (const, or, sum, tail, take)

{-
Haskell supports two kinds of comments: single line comments start with `--`
and block comments that begin and end with `{-` and `-}` respectively.

What does it mean to understand a Haskell program?
--------------------------------------------------

Our goal in this class is not just for you to be able to write programs. We
also want you to be able to reason about them both precisely and abstractly,
so that you understand exactly what they mean.

We can do this because Haskell is a functional programming language, and
\*functional* programming means that the semantics of a program can be described
mathematically. One principle of mathematics *Leibniz* equality: in any context, we
can replace any object with anything that is equal to it. In other words, if
we know that some property `P` is true about some object `A`, and `A` is equal
to `B`, then we know that the property `P` *also* holds for `B`.

Therefore, in Haskell, we reason about computation by reasoning about *equality* of sub-expressions.

For example, if we want to know what value an arithmetic expression computes
to, we only need to find some number that is equal to it.

    3 * (4 + 5)

    { 4+5 is equal to 9 by addition }

    == 3 * 9

    { by multiplication }

    == 27

That's it!

Furthermore, we can ask VSCode to compute the value of an expression for us with a
special form of comment (i.e. a single line comment that starts with '>>>').
If you are working in VSCode, try clicking on "Evaluate..." below. (You will only
see "Evaluate..." if your IDE is set up correctly.)
-}

-- >>> 3 * (4 + 5)
-- 27

{-
This sort of reasoning isn't so surprising so far. We can do the same thing in
almost any other language. What makes Haskell different is that we will be able
to use this equational reasoning in more contexts than just arithmetic.

A Haskell module is a list of definitions
-----------------------------------------

A Haskell module (like this one) is a list of *definitions*. These definitions
allow us to give names to Haskell expressions. In a module, all of the definitions
must have unique names. If we try to add another definition of `ex`, we will get
an error.
-}

ex :: Integer
ex = 3 * (4 + 5)

{-
We can ask VSCode to calculate with these names, just as we did above.
-}

-- >>> ex
-- 27

{-
Haskell definitions do not need to be in order. In a definition for one name, we
we can use any other name in the module, even if it appears later in the file.
-}

ey :: Integer
ey = ex + ez -- refers to `ex` above and `ez` below.

ez :: Integer
ez = ex + 200

-- >>> ey
-- 254

{-
Whenever we give a name to an expression, it is a good idea to also write down
its type, as we have done so for `ex` above. VSCode can often figure
out this type for you and will suggest that you add it to your file by clicking
on the suggestion. You should do so---as later error messages can be perplexing
without these additional hints.

The `Integer` type is the type of arbitrarily large integers in Haskell.
-}

bigInteger :: Integer
bigInteger = 12345678901234567890

{-
This is in contrast to the `Int` type, for word-sized integers (machine
dependent). Numbers are overloaded in Haskell, so the type annotation tells
the compiler how to interpret this expression. (And, note the warning
issued by the compiler for this out of range number!)
-}

bigInt :: Int
bigInt = 12345678901234567890

{-
Compare the value of a extra-large `Integer`
-}

-- >>> bigInteger
-- 12345678901234567890

{-
with an `Int`
-}

-- >>> bigInt
-- -6101065172474983726

{-
Above, we declared the type of an expression separately from giving it a
name. However, if we don't want to give a name to an expression, we can
still annotate it with its type using `::`.
-}

-- >>> 31 * (42 + 56) :: Integer
-- 3038

{-
More generally, the type annotation can be attached to any subexpression, not
just at the top level.
-}

-- >>> (31 :: Integer) * (42 + 56)
-- 3038

{-
It is good style to annotate the type of *every* top-level declaration in a Haskell
program. This helps with error messages, as Haskell operators, like `*`, and
constants like '31', are overloaded.

Elements of Haskell
-------------------

So far, we have have seen the following three properties of Haskell:

\* Haskell code is based on *expressions*
\* Expressions evaluate to *values*, which are equal to expressions
\* Every expression has a *type*, which may influence evaluation

You are probably familiar with expressions in other programming languages,
where they are often used to compute numeric and boolean values. Haskell also
includes these types and operators.

For example, Haskell includes floating point numbers, via the `Double` type,
using the same overloaded syntax.
-}

-- >>> 31 * (42 + 56) :: Double    -- double precision floating point

{-
Furthermore, you'll also find characters, strings and boolean values.
-}

-- >>> 'a' :: Char                 -- characters
-- 'a'

-- >>> "abcd" :: String            -- strings
-- "abcd"

-- >>> "cis" ++ "5520"             -- string concatenation
-- "cis5520"

-- >>> True :: Bool                -- boolean values
-- True

-- >>> 1 <= 3 || False && 3 > 2    -- boolean operators, comparisons
-- True

{-
What is a little different about Haskell is that everything is an expression,
including conditionals. This means that `if` can be nested inside other
expressions.
-}

-- >>> (if ex > 28 then 1 else 0) + 2 :: Int
-- 2

{-
Now the last basic type, shown below, is subtle. It is a special constant,
written `()` and called "unit". The type of this constant is written with the
same notation, and also called "unit". You'll need to pay attention to
context to know whether we mean the value or the type. The key fact about
this basic type is that there is only *one* value with type `()`. As a result,
we sometimes say that this type is "trivial" --- if we know that a variable has
type `()`, then we know that its value (if it has one) must be equal to `()`.
-}

-- >>> () :: ()            -- 'unit' (both value and type have the same syntax)
-- ()

{-
What is the point of a trivial type? In Haskell, every function is a mathematical function,
so must return some value. However, sometimes there isn't anything interesting to return, so the
function returns `()`. This is similar to the "void" type in other languages.

We'll have more to say about unit later.

What is Abstraction?
--------------------

We're going to talk a lot about *abstraction* in this course, starting from
simple examples and getting dramatically more expressive. But what is
abstraction, exactly?

The first answer is: "Pattern Recognition"

    31 * (42 + 56)

    70 * (12 + 95)

    90 * (68 + 12)

What do these expressions have in common? They all follow the same general
pattern. We can generalize that pattern to a *function* by defining an equation.
-}

pat :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer -> Integer
pat a b c = a * (b + c)

{-
We call functions by providing them with arguments.
-}

-- >>> pat 31 42 56
-- 3038

{-
No parentheses are necessary, unless the argument itself is a compound expression.
-}

-- >>> pat (30 + 1) 42 56
-- 3038

{-
The important question is not "What does this function do?"
but, instead "What does this function mean?" We can reason
about that meaning using what we know about equality.

    pat (30 + 1) 42 56

    { function call, replace a b & c in right-hand side of
    equation by (30 + 1) 42 and 56 }

    == (30 + 1) * (42 + 56)

    { addition (twice) }

    == 31 * 98

    { multiplication }

    == 3038

Functions, like `pat`, are the core abstraction mechanisms in functional
programming.

There was something subtle about the example above: we put the expression
`(30 + 1)` in for `a` in the body of `pat`. When reasoning in most languages,
it is only sound to do this replacement using values (like 31) instead general
expressions, like `(30 + 1)`. Haskell, supports more flexible
reasoning. We could have also replaced `(30 + 1)` with `31` in the first step above,
before using the equation for the function call, and we would have gotten
the same result.

Function types
--------------

Like all expressions, functions have types.

The type of a function taking an input of type `A` and yielding an output of
type `B` is written as

    A -> B

For example, the `pos` function determines whether an `Int` is strictly
greater than zero.
-}

pos :: Int -> Bool
pos x = x > 0

{-
The `pat` function above takes multiple arguments. Therefore, its type has
multiple `->`s, one for each argument.

The type of a function taking inputs of type `A1`, `A2`, and `A3` and
returning a result of type `B` is written as

    A1 -> A2 -> A3 -> B

Symbolic vs. alphabetic names
-----------------------------

Symbolic identifiers (i.e. `+` and `*`) are infix by default.

Parentheses around a symbolic name turn it into a regular
name.

For example, if we want to define an alphabetic name for the
addition function, we can do so.
-}

plus :: Int -> Int -> Int
plus = (+)

{-
And we can call operations in parentheses just like "standard" functions, by
writing their arguments afterwards.
-}

p0 :: Int
p0 = (+) 2 4

{-
Likewise we can use alphabetic name in backquotes as infix.
-}

p1 :: Int
p1 = 2 `plus` 2

{-
We can also define new symbolic infix identifiers. For example,
the `>+` operator below is just like `+`, but it adds one to the result.
When giving its type, we put it in parentheses to refer to it outside of
an infix context. However, in its definition, we put the parameters `x` and `y`
on either side of the operator.
-}

(>+) :: Int -> Int -> Int
x >+ y = x + y + 1

-- >>> 2 >+ 3
-- 6

{-
Laziness is a virtue
--------------------

One major difference between Haskell and other programming languages is that
Haskell uses a "call-by-need" semantics for evaluation, aka "lazy" evaluation.
What this means is that Haskell does not evaluate arguments before calling
functions. Instead, expressions are only evaluated when they are needed.

We can observe this behavior in Haskell by seeing what happens when we use
`error` in a subexpresion. The `error` keyword in Haskell triggers a
\*non-recoverable* runtime exception, aborting any computation in progress.
It is not a good idea to use `error` in production code, but it is convenient
for incremental development and for learning about how Haskell evaluation works.
An `error` can be used in any context and can be given
any type because it does not produce a value.
If an error is triggered, then we know that subexpression was evaluated.

For example, addition always needs to evaluate its arguments, so this
error will trigger.
-}

-- >>> 1 + 2 + 3 + error "Here!"
-- Here!

{-
However, we won't trigger an error that is in dead code, such as in
the non-selected part of an if-expression...
-}

-- >>> if 1 < 3 then 5 else error "Unreachable"
-- 5

{-
..or that was short-circuited when evaluating a boolean expression.
-}

-- >>> True || error "Unreachable"
-- True

{-
In contrast, you can see that if the first argument were `False` instead,
it does not short circuit and does trigger the error.
-}

-- >>> False || error "Here!"
-- Here!

{-
In most languages, `if` and `||` are defined via special constructs because they
include sub-expressions that are not always evaluated. However, in Haskell, these
constructs are less special. For example, you can define your own short-circuiting
version of the `or` operator. Suppose you would like this operator to have a textual
name instead of (infix) symbols:
-}

or :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
or a b = if a then True else b

{-
Through laziness, this definition short circuits, just like the Prelude version of `||`.
-}

-- >>> or True (error "Unreachable")
-- True

{-
More generally, because Haskell is lazy, the language enables more abstraction.
Functions and operators that we define can have nontrivial control behavior.

Laziness is also the reason that we can reason about Haskell programs just by thinking
about equalities. For example, there is a function in the Prelude with the following
definition:
-}

const :: a -> b -> b
const x y = y

{-
In most languages if you see a subexpression like
`const (f 3) 4`, you have to know whether the expression `f 3` produces a normal value
first before you can know that the result is 4. However, in Haskell, you can use
substitution: the pattern above says that with any call to `const`, the result is the value of
the second argument.

Thus:
-}

-- >>> const (error "Here!") 4
-- 4

{-
Laziness is unique to Haskell, and we'll see more examples of it throughout the semester.
Sometimes we use the word "strictness" to contrast with laziness. If an argument will
always be evaluated before the function is called, we call this argument "strict." In most
languages all functions are strict.

However, in Haskell, functions can be either lazy or strict, and lazy is the default.
For example, both arguments in an addition operation are strict, because we need to know what
the numbers are to sum them together. However, only the first argument in `||` is strict
because it does not evaluate the second argument when the value of the first one is `True`.

Making Haskell DO something
===========================

Programs often interact with the world:

\* Read files
\* Display graphics
\* Broadcast packets
\* Run test cases and print success or failure

They don't *just* compute values.

How does this fit with values & equalities above?

We've gotten pretty far without doing any I/O. That's fairly standard in
Haskell. Working with VSCode means that we can see the answers directly, we
don't need an action to print them out. However, a standalone executable needs
to do *something*, so we demonstrate that next.

The GHC System
--------------

We'll start with a few examples just using the interactive toplevel for the
Haskell language. Although Haskell is a compiled language, the interactive
toplevel, "ghci" is available for experimentation. You can access this
toplevel using any command prompt (i.e. Terminal), as long as you have GHC
installed. The examples below also assume that you have the "stack" tool
available and that you have started the command prompt in the same directory
that contains this source code. [Instructions for installing "stack" and
other tools are available.](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis5520/current/haskell-vscode.html)

First use the terminal to start `ghci` and instruct it to load the `Basics`
module.

    sweirich@sixteen 01-basics % stack ghci Basics.hs
    Using configuration for cis5520-basics:lib to load /Users/sweirich/552/cis5520-23fa/lectures/01-basics/Basics.lhs

    cis5520-basics> initial-build-steps (lib)
    Configuring GHCi with the following packages: cis5520-basics

    Ok, one module loaded.
    Loaded GHCi configuration from /private/var/folders/p3/pkythxvx6rq9q054797y4bb80000gn/T/haskell-stack-ghci/48e82592/ghci-script
    *Basics>

Now, with the prompt from the module, you can ask for the values, types and
information of expressions.

    *Basics> ex
    27
    *Basics> :t ex
    ex :: Integer
    *Basics> :i ex
    ex :: Integer     -- Defined at Basics.hs:5:1

Obligatory Hello World
----------------------

"IO actions" are a new sort of sort of value that describe an effect
on the world.

    IO a  --  Type of an action that returns an `a`  (a can be anything!)

Actions that *do* something but return nothing have the type `IO ()`.

    putStr :: String -> IO ()

So `putStr` takes in a string and returns an *action* that writes the string
to stdout.

Because `putStr` doesn't evaluate to a value that we can print, we can't play with
it using the IDE. Even if you hit `Evaluate...` you will see nothing because the
IDE hides the printing action.
-}

-- >>> putStr "Say what?"

{-
Instead, to observe the printing action, we need to use GHCi. Let's give this action
a name first:
-}

hw :: IO ()
hw = putStr "Hello World!\n"

{-
and then we can give it a try.

    *Basics> hw
    Hello World!
    *Basics>

Just 'do' it
-------------
How can we do many actions?  By composing small actions.

The `do` syntax allows us to create a compound action that sequences one
action after another. The definition of `many` below is a compound action
that outputs the three strings in order. (Try it out in ghci!)
-}

many :: IO ()
many = do
  putStr "Hello" -- each line in the sequence
  putStr " World!" -- must be an IO action
  putStr "\n" -- don't forget the newline

{-
Note: white-space is significant here. The `do` notation sequences actions, but
each action in the sequence must start at the same character offset: all of
the `putStr`s must be lined up.

Sometimes people put the `do` on a line by itself and then start the list
of actions on the next line. This saves column width in larger developments.
-}

many' :: IO ()
many' = do
  putStr "Hello"
  putStr " World!"
  putStr "\n"

{-
Observe that we are taking advantage of laziness when we construct these actions.
The `many` action does some printing, but that printing doesn't happen when when
we define `many` --- only later when we run it in ghci.

Example: Input Action
---------------------

Actions can also return a value.

    getLine :: IO String

This action reads and returns a line from stdin.  We can name the result
as part of a `do` sequence, with this notation, called "bind".

    x <- action

Here `x` is a variable that can be used to refer to the result of the
action in later code. For example, below, `n` is new `String` variable
that is initialized by reading from stdin.
-}

query :: IO ()
query = do
  putStr "What is your name? "
  n <- getLine
  putStrLn ("Welcome to CIS 5520 " ++ n)

{-
Any `IO t` action can be used with bind to create a variable of type `t`.
However, when working with type `IO ()` the result is a special value,
written `()` and called "unit". This special value indicates that the IO
action did not have anything interesting to return---similar to a method
that returns "void" in other programming languages.
What is different in Haskell is that we do have a value of type `()`,
and we can name it with bind, as shown in `query'` below. However, we probably
won't do anything with this value.
(Note that this example also demonstrates the Haskell convention to name
variables that are unused with names that start with an underscore.)
-}

query' :: IO ()
query' = do
  _m <- putStr "What is your name? "
  n <- getLine
  putStrLn ("Welcome to CIS 5520 " ++ n)

{-
Note that you cannot name the *last* action in a sequence. Names are there so that
you can use their results later. If you want to return the value instead, the last action
should be a `return`.
-}

query2 :: IO String -- compare this type to `query` above.
query2 = do
  putStr "What is your name? "
  n <- getLine
  return n

{-
Furthermore, there is no need to name a value if it is just going to be
returned right away. This version is also equivalent.
-}

query2' :: IO String
query2' = do
  putStr "What is your name? "
  getLine

{-
Example: Testing Actions
------------------------

The `hunit` library contains definitions for constructing unit tests for your
programs. You must import this library at the top of your module (with
import Test.HUnit`) before you can access these definitions.  This library
defines a `Test` type for test cases.
-}

-- | A test case that, when run, checks that the result of computation
-- matches the expected value 3
t1 :: Test
t1 = (1 + 2 :: Int) ~?= 3

{-
\* Haskell is lazy by default, so these definitions *create* tests, but don't
actually run them yet. We'll do that below.

\* The `(~?=)` operator is overloaded. You can create tests that compare
expressions at many different types. When the expressions themselves are also
overloaded (such as those with numbers), we run into ambiguity---what type of
expressions should this test actually use? We resolve that ambiguity with
an internal typing annotation `(3 :: Int)`.

To run the test case, we use the function `runTestTT`.

           runTestTT :: Test -> IO Counts
-}

numTest :: IO Counts
numTest = runTestTT t1

{-
This expression is an action that runs the test case(s) and returns a data
structure (of type `Counts`) recording how many tests cases were run and how
many failed or produced errors. A failing test case is caused by a false
assertion, for example `True ~?= False`. An erroroneous testcase is one that
produced a run-time error, such as division by zero.

Although we can evaluate `numTest` in the IDE, we get more information about
failing and erroroneous tests using `ghci`.

          *Basics> runTestTT (True ~?= False)
          ### Failure:
          <interactive>:16
          expected: False
          but got: True
          Cases: 1  Tried: 1  Errors: 0  Failures: 1
          Counts {cases = 1, tried = 1, errors = 0, failures = 1}

          *Basics> runTestTT ( 1 `div` 0 ~?= (1 :: Int))
          ### Error:
          divide by zero
          Cases: 1  Tried: 1  Errors: 1  Failures: 0
          Counts {cases = 1, tried = 1, errors = 1, failures = 0}

Structured Data
===============

Tuples
------

An ordered sequence of values is called a *tuple* and its type is written as
(where `A1` ... `An` are the types of the values in the sequence).

        (A1, ..., An)

For example,
-}

tup1 :: (Char, Int)
tup1 = ('a', 5)

tup2 :: (Char, Double, Int)
tup2 = ('a', 5.2, 7)

tup3 :: ((Int, Double), Bool)
tup3 = ((7, 5.2), True)

{-
There can be any number of elements in a tuple, but the structure must match
the type.

\*Pattern Matching* extracts values from tuples.

A function that takes a tuple as an argument *looks* like it has multiple
arguments, but in reality, it has just one. We use a *pattern* to name the
three components of the tuple for use in the function.
-}

tpat :: (Int, Int, Int) -> Int
tpat (a, b, c) = a * (b + c)

{-
We can put *anything* in a tuple
--------------------------------

We can have tuples of tuples. These three values below have three different
types. Look closely!  (We use the word 'pair' to describe a tuple with two
values.)
-}

tup4 :: ((Int, Int), Int)
tup4 = ((1, 2), 3) -- a pair of a pair and a number

tup5 :: (Int, (Int, Int))
tup5 = (1, (2, 3)) -- a pair of a number and a pair
{-

-}

tup6 :: (Int, Int, Int)
tup6 = (1, 2, 3) -- a three-tuple, or triple

{-
Note that the pattern that names the variables must match the structure of the
type *exactly*.
-}

pat4 :: ((Int, Int), Int) -> Int
pat4 ((a, b), c) = a * (b + c)

-- >>> pat4 tup4
-- 5

pat5 :: (Int, (Int, Int)) -> Int
pat5 (a, (b, c)) = a * (b + c)

-- >>> pat5 tup5
-- 5

pat6 :: (Int, Int, Int) -> Int
pat6 (a, b, c) = a * (b + c)

-- >>> pat6 tup6
-- 5

{-
We can stick anything in tuples, even IO actions.
-}

act2 :: (IO (), IO ())
act2 = (putStr "Hello", putStr "Hello")

{-
This doesn't actually run both actions, it just creates a pair holding two IO
computations. Haskell doesn't evaluate the components of a tuple when it is
constructed. It waits until you actually need it.

Compare the difference between these definitions in ghci. Try to predict what
they will do.
-}

runAct2 :: IO ()
runAct2 = do
  let (x, y) = act2 -- pattern match in `do` sequences using `let`
  x -- run the first action
  y -- then run the second

runAct2' :: IO ()
runAct2' = do
  let (x, y) = act2 -- pattern match
  y -- run the second action
  x -- then run the first

runAct2'' :: IO ()
runAct2'' = do
  let (x, y) = act2 -- pattern match
  x -- run the first action
  x -- then run it again!

{-
Optional values
---------------

The type of "optional" or "partial" values is written

        Maybe A

This type describes either a value of type `A`, or else nothing.
-}

m1 :: Maybe Int
m1 = Just 2 -- the 'Just' tag tells the compiler that we have a value

m2 :: Maybe Int
m2 = Nothing -- the 'Nothing' tag means there is no value

{-
The `Nothing` value of the `Maybe` type often plays the role that `null` does
in other languages. But note that `Nothing` is not a value of type `Int` or
`String` or any other type. It is a value of type `Maybe Int`. This means that
we can't accidentally use `Nothing` where we need an `Int`. This is a good
thing, because it means that we can't be surprised by `null` --- the types tell
us exactly when a value could be `Nothing`.

'Maybe' is useful for partial functions
---------------------------------------

A common use of the `Maybe` type is for functions that don't always have a value
to return. For example, suppose we know the location of some, but not all, classes
in the CIS department. For the ones that we have no information about, we can
return `Nothing`.
-}

location :: String -> Maybe String
location "cis5010" = Just "Wu & Chen"
location "cis5020" = Just "Heilmeier"
location "cis5200" = Just "Wu & Chen"
location "cis5520" = Just "3401 Walnut, 401B"
location _ = Nothing -- wildcard pattern, matches anything

{-
Extracting values from 'Maybe's
--------------------------------

Pattern matching extracts values from `Maybe`s; we need a pattern for each
case.
-}

pat'' :: Maybe Int -> Int
pat'' (Just x) = x
pat'' Nothing = 2

{-
Patterns can be nested, too.
-}

jn :: Maybe (Maybe a) -> Maybe a
jn (Just (Just x)) = Just x
jn (Just Nothing) = Nothing
jn Nothing = Nothing

{-
\**Quiz**: See if you can come up with a slightly simpler way to write `jn` using two
patterns instead of three. The `undefined` expression is one that produces a run-time
error if it is ever evaluated.
-}

jn' :: Maybe (Maybe a) -> Maybe a
jn' (Just x) = x
jn' Nothing = Nothing

{-
Lists
=====

The type of a list of values, each of type `A` is written

       [A]

A list is a sequence of values of the same type. There is no limit to
the number of values that can be stored in a list. We notate lists as
a sequence of comma-separated values inside square brackets.
-}

l1 :: [Double]
l1 = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]

l2 :: [Int]
l2 = [1, 2, 3, 4] -- make a list of numbers

{-
Lists can contain structured data...
-}

l3 :: [(Int, Bool)]
l3 = [(1, True), (2, False)]

{-
...and can be nested:
-}

l4 :: [[Int]]
l4 = [[1, 2], [2, 3]] -- make a list of lists

{-
List elements *must* have the same type.
-}

-- l5 :: [Int]
-- l5 = [ 1 , True ]  -- doesn't type check

{-
(Observe the type error that results when you uncomment the definition above.)

The empty list is written `[]` and pronounced "nil".
-}

l6 :: [a]
l6 = []

{-
\*Note*: `String` is just another name for a list of characters (`[Char]`).
-}

l7 :: String
l7 = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', '5', '5', '2', '0', '!']

{-
What is the value of l7?
-}

-- >>> l7
-- "hello 5520!"
--

{-
"Cons"tructing Lists
---------------------

The infix operator `:` constructs a new list, by adding a new element to the
front of an existing list. (Note, the existing list is not modified.)
We call this operator `cons`.

(The `a` in the type of `cons` below means that this function works for lists
containing *any* type of element. In other words, we say that this function
is *polymorphic*. More on this later.)
-}

cons :: a -> [a] -> [a]
cons = (:)

c1 :: [Bool]
c1 = True : [False, False]

c2 :: [Int]
c2 = 1 : []

{-
Try evaluating `c1` and `c2`.
-}

-- >>> c1
-- [True,False,False]
--
-- >>> c2
-- [1]
--

{-
And check out the type of `c3`.
-}

c3 = [] : []

{-
Strings
-------

The `String` type in Haskell is syntactic sugar for a list of characters. Haskell
doesn't distinguish between the types `[Char]` and `String`. For example, here
are two different ways to write the same list:
-}

s1 :: [Char]
s1 = "abc"

{-
>
-}

s2 :: String
s2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']

{-
Try evaluating `s1` and `s2`.
-}

-- >>> s1
-- "abc"
--
-- >>> s2
-- "abc"
--

{-
Syntactic Sugar for lists
--------------------------

Haskell views the notation

    [x1, x2, .. , xn]

as short for

    x1 : x2 : .. : xn : []

This means that we can think of lists as a sequence of cons'ed elements,
ending with nil.  For example,

    [1,2,3,4]  and  1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : []

are the same list.
-}

-- >>> [1,2,3,4] == 1:2:3:4:[]
-- True

{-
Function practice: List Generation
----------------------------------

\**Example**: Write a function that, given an argument `x` and a number `n`, returns
a list containing `n` copies of `x`.

\**Step 1**: Write test cases for the function.

We're using HUnit, a library for defining unit tests in Haskell and using the
`~?=` operator to construct unit `Test`s by comparing the computed result
(first argument) with an expected result (second argument).
-}

testClone1, testClone2, testClone3, testClone4 :: Test
testClone1 = clone 'a' 4 ~?= ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']
testClone2 = clone 'a' 0 ~?= []
testClone3 = clone (1.1 :: Double) 3 ~?= [1.1, 1.1, 1.1]
testClone4 = clone 'a' (-1) ~?= []

{-
\**Step 2**: Declare the type of the function.

This function replicates any type of value, so the type of the first argument
is polymorphic.
-}

clone :: a -> Int -> [a]
{-
\**Step 3**: Implement the function.

We implement this function by recursion on the integer argument.
-}

clone x n = if n <= 0 then [] else x : clone x (n - 1)

{-
\**Step 4**: Run the tests.

The HUnit function `runTestTT` actually runs a given unit test and prints
its result to the standard output stream. (That is why its result type is `IO
Counts`. The IO in the type means that this computation does IO.)
-}

cl1, cl2, cl3, cl4 :: IO Counts
cl1 = runTestTT testClone1
cl2 = runTestTT testClone2
cl3 = runTestTT testClone3
cl4 = runTestTT testClone4

{-
or
-}

cls :: IO Counts
cls = runTestTT (TestList [testClone1, testClone2, testClone3, testClone4])

{-
You can run the tests by evaluating the definition `cls` at the ghci prompt.

    ghci> cls
    Cases: 4  Tried: 4  Errors: 0  Failures: 0
    Counts {cases = 4, tried = 4, errors = 0, failures = 0}

Function practice
-----------------

\**Quiz**: Define a function called `range` that, given two integers `i` and `j`,
returns a list containing all of the numbers at least as big as `i` but no
bigger than `j`, in order.

\**Step 1**: Write test cases. We can define multiple test cases at once using a list.
-}

testRange :: Test
testRange =
  TestList
    [ range 3 6 ~?= [3, 4, 5, 6],
      range 42 42 ~?= [42],
      range 10 5 ~?= []
    ]

{-
\**Step 2**: Declare the type of the function.
-}

range :: Int -> Int -> [Int]
{-
\**Step 3**: Define the function. This part is for you to do for your quiz.
-}

range i j = if i > j then [] else i : range (i+1) j

{-
\**Step 4**: Run the tests.
-}

runRTests :: IO Counts
runRTests = runTestTT testRange

{-
Pattern matching with lists
---------------------------

The examples so far have *constructed* various lists. Of course, sometimes
we would like to write functions that *use* lists. We can use a list by
pattern matching...
-}

isHi :: String -> Bool
isHi ['H', 'i'] = True
isHi _ = False

{-
If we have a list of characters, we can use string constants as patterns too.
-}

isGreeting :: String -> Bool
isGreeting "Hi" = True
isGreeting "Hello" = True
isGreeting "Bonjour" = True
isGreeting "Guten Tag" = True
isGreeting _ = False

{-
We can also work with lists more abstractly, for example determining if we have
a list of length one...
-}

isSingleton :: [a] -> Bool
isSingleton [_] = True
isSingleton _ = False

{-
...or of length greater than two. Complete this one yourself using a pattern to identify
lists that have three or more elements.
-}

isLong :: [a] -> Bool
isLong [] = False
isLong [_] = False
isLong [_, _] = False
isLong _ = True

testIsLong :: Test
testIsLong =
  TestList
    [ not (isLong []) ~? "nil", -- can convert booleans to tests by naming them via `~?`
      not (isLong "a") ~? "one",
      not (isLong "ab") ~? "two",
      isLong "abc" ~? "three"
    ]

runLongTests :: IO Counts
runLongTests = runTestTT testIsLong
{-
Finally, all of the patterns we have shown you so far have been part of definitions. We can define a function, like `isSingleton` or `isGreeting` above, by cases, using multiple lines. This style is common in Haskell, but if you are coming from OCaml, you might be more familiar with `match`, or a separate expression form of pattern matching. Such a form is also available in Haskell, using the `case` and `of` keywords.

For example, we can rewrite `isGreeting` using `case` instead.
-}

isGreeting2 :: String -> Bool
isGreeting2 s =
  case s of
    "Hi" -> True
    "Hello" -> True
    "Bonjour" -> True
    "Guten Tag" -> True
    _ -> False

{-
Note that all of the patterns in a case expression must start in the same column of your source file. This expression is layout sensitive, and if things don't line up, you will get a compilation error. Case expressions are particularly good for *nested* patterns, where you might want to match again inside of a branch. Here's a silly definition of `isGreeting` that demonstrates a nested pattern. Note how the layout determines where the patterns for the inner `case` end and the ones for the outer `case` resume.
-}

isGreeting3 :: String -> Bool
isGreeting3 s =
  case s of
    ('H' : r) -> case r of
      "i" -> True
      "ello" -> True
      _ -> False
    "Bonjour" -> True
    "Guten Tag" -> True
    _ -> False

{-
Function practice: List Recursion
------------------------------

\**Example*: Define a function called `listSum` that, given a list of `Int`s returns
their sum.

\**Step 1**: Write test cases.
-}

sumTests :: Test
sumTests =
  TestList
    [ sum [1, 2, 3] ~?= 6,
      sum [] ~?= 0
    ]

{-
\**Step 2**: Declare the type of the function.
-}

sum :: [Int] -> Int
{-
\**Step 3**: Define the function. (Use pattern matching to define the function by
case analysis.)
-}

sum [] = 0
sum (x : xs) = x + sum xs

{-
\**Step 4**: Run the tests.
-}

runSumTests :: IO Counts
runSumTests = runTestTT sumTests

{-
Note that `listAdd` follows a general pattern of working with lists called *list
recursion*.  We can define lists as follows.

A list is either

- `[]`, the empty list, or
- `x : xs`, an element `x` cons'ed onto another list `xs`.

This is a recursive definition, as we are defining the notion of lists in terms
of itself.  Recursive functions that work with lists will follow the
pattern of this definition:

    f :: [a] -> ...
    f [] =  ...       -- case for the empty list
    f (x : xs) = ...  -- case for a nonempty list, will use `f xs`
                      -- recursively somehow.

Function practice: List access
------------------------------

Define a function, called `take`, that, given a number n and a list,
returns the first n items in the list, or the whole list if there are
fewer than n items.

\**Step 1**: Write test cases.
-}

takeTests :: Test
takeTests =
  TestList
    [ take 1 [1, 2, 3] ~?= [1],
      take 5 [1, 2, 3] ~?= [1, 2, 3]
    ]

{-
\**Step 2**: Declare the type of the function. This function
is polymorphic and works with any element type.
-}

take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
{-
\**Step 3**: Define the function.
-}

take 0 xs = []
take n [] = []
take n (x : xs) = x : take (n - 1) xs

{-
\**Step 4**: Run the tests.
-}

runTakeTests :: IO Counts
runTakeTests = runTestTT takeTests

{-
Function practice: List transformation
------------------------------------

Define a function, called `listIncr`, that, given a list of ints,
returns a new list where each number has been incremented.

\**Step 1**: Write test cases.
-}

listIncrTests :: Test
listIncrTests =
  TestList
    [ listIncr [1, 2, 3] ~?= [2, 3, 4],
      listIncr [42] ~?= [43]
    ]

{-
\**Step 2**: Declare the type of the function.
-}

listIncr :: [Int] -> [Int]
{-
\**Step 3**: Define the function.
-}

listIncr [] = []
listIncr (x : xs) = (x + 1) : listIncr xs

{-
\**Step 4**: Run the tests.
-}

runLITests :: IO Counts
runLITests = runTestTT listIncrTests

{-
Function practice: Double List transformation
---------------------------------------------

Define a function, called `listAdd`, that, given two lists of
numbers, adds them together pointwise. Any extra numbers are ignored.

\**Step 1**: Write test cases.
-}

listAddTests :: Test
listAddTests =
  TestList
    [ listAdd [1, 2, 3] [2, 4, 5] ~?= [3, 6, 8],
      listAdd [42] [] ~?= []
    ]

{-
\**Step 2**: Declare the type of the function.
-}

listAdd :: [Int] -> [Int] -> [Int]
{-
\**Step 3**: Define the function.
-}

listAdd [] _ = []
listAdd _ [] = []
listAdd (x1 : xs1) (x2 : xs2) = (x1 + x2) : listAdd xs1 xs2

{-
\**Step 4**: Run the tests.

runLAddTests :: IO Counts
runLAddTests = runTestTT listAddTests

-- >>> runLAddTests
-- Counts {cases = 2, tried = 2, errors = 0, failures = 0}

{-
Coda: "Infinite" lists
----------------------

The `:` operator is lazy in Haskell. When we create a list we don't need to
know the value of all of the elements.
-}

-- >>> take 2 (1 : 2 : 3 : error "unreachable")
-- [1,2]

{-
Because `:` is lazy, we can define lists in terms of themselves. This list
has as many ones as you want it to contain.
-}

ones :: [Int]
ones = 1 : ones

{-
Do NOT try to print this list.
-}

-- >>> ones

{-
But, we can work with any finite prefix of the list without trouble.
-}

-- >>> take 17 ones
-- [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

{-
And, we can use this technique to define many different series of
numbers. For example, we can define a simple incrementing series.
-}

allNums :: [Int]
allNums = 1 : listIncr allNums

-- >>> take 17 allNums
-- [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]

{-
And we can define the Fibonacci series. (The `tail` function below
is also defined in the Haskell standard library and returns the list without
its first element. Note: in general you should avoid this function when
working with finite lists as it could trigger an error. In some projects,
we have configured `hlint` to warn you about this function.)

-}

tail :: [Int] -> [Int]
tail (_ : xs) = xs
tail [] = error "tail of empty list"

fibs :: [Int]
fibs = 1 : 1 : listAdd fibs (tail fibs)

-- >>> take 17 fibs
-- [1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597]
